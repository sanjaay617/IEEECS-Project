# IEEECS-Project
In this project I have tried to replicate the RocketAir website. I have done the landing page. I have uploaded the code for it and the images and videos used in it. I have connected my github page to my vs code. You can download the code and media files along with it and use a coding a platform to look at the output or connect your vs code to this repository and look at the webpage
I have animated the text and animated the rotating circle in the table.
